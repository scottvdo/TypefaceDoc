<h3> Inspiration </h3>
<p> When exploring for creative ways to build my typeface project, I was inspired by the playfullness and geometric characteristics of Tangrams. Tangrams are similar to building blocks, however they are used as a tool for children to learn about spatial geometry through play. I thought that this would be a fun and interesting way to interpret a typeface. Below are some sources I used as reference for the typeface I created.</p>

<h3> Process Work </h3>

<p>Below is my handwritten draft of the typeface I created. I had a lot of fun brainstorming different methods of building these letters.
